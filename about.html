            <p>Hi! I'm Hannah, a student with WhiteHat Jr. I recently started learning HTML and CSS, and used my new skills to create websites, including this one.</p>
            <p>I have to fill up the page so here are some random facts about me:</p>
            <li>I'm 13 years old</li>
            <li>Born in Canada and raised all over it</li>
            <li>I have no social media except YouTube, but that doesn't really count</li>
            <li>I'm 4 years ahead of my grade level in math</li>
            <li>Never broke a bone</li>
            <li>Fluent in French</li>
            <li>I'm an aspiring classical pianist</li>
            <li>Twosetter :D</li>
            <li>Ling Ling frowns upon me</li>
            <li>I'm a failure</li>
            <li>My hands are too tiny for Chopin ;-;</li>
            <li>Chopin is the best</li>
            <li>Apparently I'm sorta smart :0</li>
            <li>I thouroughly enjoy coding</li>
            <li>Can't draw, although my friends think otherwise</li>
            <li>I don't even know what most of the emojis mean</li>
            <li>Super unfamiliar with Gen-Z language (even though I'm a part of it lol)</li>
            <li>The only teacher who ever hated me was ny grade 4 teacher. Oh yeah, and that one substitute who was my former classmate and sworn enemy's grandma. She kiched my monkey eraser to the other end of the room.</li>
            <li>I named that eraser "Monkay" ("monkey" with a French accent) in grade 6</li>
            <li>I find writing fun, and my history teacher thinks I'm good at it. I disagree</li>
            <li>I'm writing a documentary in French based on what I learned from the Octonauts</li>
            <li>Can sorta communicate in Italian</li>
            <li>I suck at Farsi</li>
            <li>I never remember to wear the right glasses XD</li>
            <p>I only did that because I wanted the bonus points (just kidding). Did you really need to know all that? No. But when someone says "tell me about yourself", I do.</p>
            <p>If you made it down here, to the bottom of the page of nonsensical (is that even a word?) rubbish, well done. Here's a virtual high five for you. And thank you for taking the time to read this. :)</p>
            <p>tee-hee</p>
